Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation of the cycle sort algorithm:

* Start with an unsorted array of n elements.
* Initialize a variable, cycleStart, to 0.
* For each element in the array, compare it with every other element to its right. If there are any elements that are smaller than the current element, increment cycleStart.
* If cycleStart is still 0 after comparing the first element with all other elements, move to the next element and repeat step 3.
* Once a smaller element is found, swap the current element with the first element in its cycle. The cycle is then continued until the current element returns to its original position.
* Repeat steps 3-5 until all cycles have been completed.

The array is now sorted.
