ALGORITHM -
* Take three-pointers, namely - low, mid, high.
* We use low and mid pointers at the start, and the high pointer will point at the end of the given array.

CASES :
* If array [mid] =0, then swap array [mid] with array [low] and increment both pointers once.
* If array [mid] = 1, then no swapping is required. Increment mid pointer once.
* If array [mid] = 2, then we swap array [mid] with array [high] and decrement the high pointer once.
