* What is tree?
-> A tree is a non-linear abstract data type with a hierarchy-based structure. It consists of nodes 
(where the data is stored) that are connected via links.The tree data structure stems from a single 
node called a root node and has subtrees connected to the root.


* Why we use tree?
1) You can insert, delete, find node in  O(logN) time.
2) Data are stored in order


* Where is it used?
1) File systems
2) Databases
3) Algorithms/ Networking
4) Maths
5) DTS (Machine Learning)
6) Compression of file
7) In Heaps, graphs tree is used


* Properties of tree :
1) size = Total number of nodes
2) child =
3) parent = 
4) height = Max no of edges from the key node to the leaf node
5) level =
